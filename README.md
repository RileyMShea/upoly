# upoly

An Asyncio based, high performance client libary for interacting
with the polygon REST api.

## Installation

This library makes use of some high performance packages written in `C`/`Rust`
(uvloop, orjson) so it may require `python-dev` on ubuntu or similar on
other OS's.

## Usage

create a copy of `./env.sample` as `./env`

## TODO

- [ ] unit tests
- [ ] regression tests
- [ ] integration tests
- [ ] `/trade` endpoint functionality for tick data
